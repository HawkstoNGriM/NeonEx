# NeonEx
A platform for CMS version detection, exploit suggestion and CVE display based on vulnerability.

# DO NOT CLONE, This is still a work in progress !!
> Missing dependencies rn, dont clone.
> (missing Resources folder, 300mb)

# Dependencies 
-Resources folder - includes:
>exploits and cves CSV files
-a bunch of my scripts

# Aggressiveness
This scanner DOES NOT scan for ports, it DOES NOT dirbust/dirb/ , it DOES NOT attempt injections - it is a passive scanner (it only sends few requests to your website, so far max i've seen is 10, usually its around 5-6) and therefore it is safer and easier on the website load. 

# Scripts used
CMS detection script is from https://github.com/Krisseck/Detect-CMS
0daytoday from unofficial API (i think this one https://github.com/MrSentex/0day.today-API)
Exploitdb from https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb

# TODO 
a bunch
